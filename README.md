# OSSU-Courses

I began my CS studies in November 2016.  I choose this path becuase I already have a BFA and I didn't want to spend the time or money on non-CS courses by enrolling at a traditional university.  I believe that the path offered by OSSU was the best for me to obtain the education required to pursue a career in tech as a programmer.  So far, so good!

Update: November 2017 - At this time, I've completed several courses with an overall average grade of 97.  The OSSU course list has changed since I began which has caused a few scheduling problems.  Due to this, and also issues with course availability, I am no longer following the OSSU strictly but instead using it as a suggested list.  I am currently enrolled in LAFF: Linear Algebra vie EdX and working on a game app using OOP Java.  

Update: December 2017 - I have completed my game app. Battleship, in OOP Java, https://github.com/winterfive/learning_OOP_Java/tree/master/Battleship_updated.  While on holiday haitus from my LAFF course, I am coding every day using Java and Python and working my way through Head First Design Patterns and various HackerRank challenges.

Update: Feb 2018 - On the advice of several mentors, I am no longer enrolled in any math courses and focusing on coding (open source PRs, projects, hackerrank warm ups).  I am also studying design patterns and algorithms.  More code, less class time.  Learn by doing.
