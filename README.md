# OSSU-Courses

I began my CS studies in November 2016.  Since I already have a BFA, I didn't want to spend the time or money on non-CS courses by enrolling at a traditional university.  I felt that the path offered by OSSU was the best for me to obtain the education required to pursue a career in tech as a programmer.  So far, so good!
