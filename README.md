# OSSU-Courses

I began my CS studies in November 2016.  I choose this path becuase I already have a BFA and I didn't want to spend the time or money on non-CS courses by enrolling at a traditional university.  I believe that the path offered by OSSU was the best for me to obtain the education required to pursue a career in tech as a programmer.  So far, so good!

Update: November 2017 - At this time, I've completed several courses with an overall GPA of 97.  The OSSU course list has changed since I began which has cuased a few scheduling problems.  Due to this, and also issues with course availability, I am no longer following the OSSU strictly but instead using it as a suggested list.  I am currently enrolled in LAFF: Linear Algebra vie EdX and working on a game app using OOP Java.
